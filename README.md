My project is a 2d platformer game made in Godot. it is based around the theme of sleepover. the player moves through cloud-based levels, collecting strs while avoiding falling and dying. there are 3 levels that progessively get harder, with platfors moving horizontally, vertically and diagonlly. if the player dies they will lose all strs. to fully complete the game , the player should collect all 45 stars. at the end of the game there is a "YOU'RE AWAKE" screen wher the player can choose to play again. the game includes calming music witha settings button and a controls help button.

this is my first time making a game so iwanted to start ith something fairly simple. i also wanted to fit the theme of sleepove

being my first game it was challenging to figure out how to make moving platforms, scene transitions, track stars and handle the player restarting the levels. balancing the difficulty so it was fun to make but also could be fustrting at times.

i desgned three levels based on clouds that progressively get harder:
level 1 - platforms move horizontally
level 2 - platforms move horizontally and vertically
level 3 - platforms move horizontally, vertically and diagonally
